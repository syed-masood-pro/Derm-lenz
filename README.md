<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
"Derm Lens" is an AI-based Mobile and Web App designed to accurately identify dermatological diseases. Users can upload images of skin lesions or rashes, which are then analyzed by the app's AI system. The app provides users with a list of possible diagnoses, along with relevant information about each condition, empowering users to take control of their skin health.

- #### Intel® oneAPI is used to optimize the models to provide an accurate and efficient prediction.
- #### Providing adequate care to under-served regions.
- #### All of our models have an accuracy of 82%.

<!-- Intel one api -->
## Intel® oneAPI
Intel® OneAPI is a comprehensive development platform for building high-performance, cross-architecture applications. It provides a unified programming model, tools, and libraries that allow developers to optimize their applications for Intel® CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other hardware. Intel® OneAPI includes support for popular programming languages like C++, Python, and Fortran, as well as frameworks for deep learning, high-performance computing, and data analytics. With Intel® OneAPI, developers can build applications that can run on various hardware platforms, and take advantage of the performance benefits of Intel® architectures.
<!-- Use of oneAPI in our project -->
### Use of oneAPI in our project

In this section, we'll outline how we utilized various Intel® oneAPI libraries and frameworks to enhance the performance and efficiency of our models.

* <b>Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit accelerates data science and analytics with Python®</b>

The Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit) offers an integrated solution for preprocessing, machine learning, and model development. To optimize deep learning training on Intel® XPUs and streamline inference, We utilized the toolkit's Intel®-optimized deep-learning frameworks for TensorFlow*.

Installation:
<code>!pip install --upgrade intel-extension-for-tensorflow[cpu]</code> 

By integrating Intel® Extension for TensorFlow*, We achieved substantial acceleration, with performance gains ranging from 10x to 100x across various applications.

* <b>Intel® oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)</b>

To optimize deep learning applications on Intel® CPUs and GPUs, We integrated the oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN). To enable oneDNN optimizations for TensorFlow* running on Intel® hardware, We used the following code:

<code>os.environ['TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS'] = '1'
os.environ['DNNL_ENGINE_LIMIT_CPU_CAPABILITIES'] = '0'</code> 

Before training our models, We disabled the system allocator using the following code to enhance performance:

<code>os.environ['TF_ONEDNN_USE_SYSTEM_ALLOCATOR'] = '0'</code>

After training and before inference, We re-enabled the system allocator using:

<code>os.environ['TF_ONEDNN_USE_SYSTEM_ALLOCATOR'] = '1'</code>

Moreover, We assumed frozen weights for inference using:

<code>os.environ['TF_ONEDNN_ASSUME_FROZEN_WEIGHTS'] = '1'</code>

#### Model Specifics and Usage
Dermatological Disease Classification(10 Classes) models are TensorFlow-based. For these, We used the Intel® Extension for TensorFlow* from the AI Kit, oneDAL, oneDPL and oneDNN to enhance performance. The description generator using the FLAN-T5 Model was optimized using Code Generation with LLMs
Streamline and enhance the code development process with cutting-edge LLMs.
